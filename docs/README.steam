[h1]X4 Player Ship Trade Analyzer[/h1]

[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4PlayerShipTradeAnalyzer/refs/heads/main/docs/images/title360.jpg[/img]

A simple, fast desktop tool for X4: Foundations players to understand their ship's trading performance. Point it at your game folder and a save file and get clear insights into:
[list]
[*] Which wares make you the most profit
[*] How each of your ships has been trading over time
[*] Totals for price, quantity, and estimated profit per transaction
[/list]
[b]Important notice[/b]: Please be aware - trade logs are collected by game for AI pilots only.

The app runs locally and reads only your X4 files. Nothing is uploaded. [b]Nothing is MODDED![/b]

[h2][b]Key features[/b][/h2]
